1.  --public: access is not limited
    --private: access is limited to the current class
    --protected: access is limited to the current class and subclasses
    --internal: access is limited to the current assembly
    --protected internal: access is limited to the current assembly or subclass
    --private protected: access is limited to the containing class or subclass whithin the current assembly
    
2.  --static: can not be instantiated, belong to the type itself
    --const: the value is set in compile time and can not be changed
    --readonly: the value is set in runtime and cannot be changed

3. Constructors are used to initialize a new instance of that class

4. it is used to split a class, struct, interface into multiple files. It is useful when the project is too large
    or separately implementing interfaces

5. It is a data structure that is immutable and can store elements of different datatypes

6. record keyword defines a reference type that provide built-in functionality fro encapsulating data.

7. overload means to have same method name but different parameters in child class than in the parent class. Where override means
    the child class has the same method (name and parameters) as the parent class

8. A field is a variable decleared in a class. A property acts as a public interface to a field. Property use getters and setters to access field

9. By specifying a default value like int a= 3

10. Interface will always have abstract method. A class can implement multiple interfaces but only one abstract class

11. all methods are public in an interface
